This is my first blog post using Hugo. Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator built in Go.

## Why Hugo?

1. Speed: Hugo is one of the fastest static site generators available.
2. Flexibility: It supports a wide range of content types and output formats.
3. Easy to use: With its simple structure and Markdown support, creating content is a breeze.
